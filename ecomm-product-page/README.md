# Project Overview

This project began as an attempt to build a website primarily using CSS, HTML, and basic JavaScript as a translation of a local designers vision for a portfolio piece. As I progressed, I decided to undertake a significant refactor to enhance the functionality and maintainability of the codebase.

## Key Features and Improvements

- **Dynamic Data Handling**: Instead of hard coding data, I refactored the project to pull variable information from a JSON file using the Fetch API. This approach improved the flexibility and scalability of the application.
- **Custom Code**: All the code in this project is custom-written, without relying on external packages or copy-pasting from the web. This includes the lightbox and cart functionality, which I built from scratch using online resources for guidance.

- **PixelPerfect Integration**: To ensure design accuracy, I utilized the PixelPerfect extension to fine-tune my code, achieving a nearly 95% match with the design specifications.

## Reflections

I am proud of the work accomplished in this project. It challenged me to deepen my understanding of front-end development and improve my problem-solving skills. I have included comprehensive documentation throughout the codebase to facilitate readability and maintenance.
